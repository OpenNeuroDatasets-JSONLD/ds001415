Derivatives are provided for convenience, but could be re-produced from the
sourcedata and/or image files.  Scripts that prepared these derivatives are 
available from UO Scholars Bank at https://doi.org/10.7264/3b49-tr85.


Fieldmap
========
The computed fieldmap files were produced with the FSL utilities 
fsl_prepare_fieldmap, fslmaths, and BET.

fieldmap/sub-NN/sub-NN_rads.nii.gz
	Computed fieldmap in radians/second to apply B0 unwarping

fieldmap/sub-NN/sub-NN_mag_brain.nii.gz
	Brain extracted distortion magnitude image


Explanatory Variables
=====================
Stimulus timing information extracted from log files and formatted in three
column format for use in FSL (FMRIB).  There is one for each audio type - 
sequential, "augmented" (i.e., augmented-sequential), and concurrent - and for 
each run (1 or 2).  The timing is unique to each participant and run, as the 
order of trials was randomized.  A simplified (relative to the full PsychoPy 
(Peirce 2007) output; see "sourcedata") summary of all events is provided in 
evDetails.csv.
